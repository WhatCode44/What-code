  We are 2 people to own this programming channel, our name is Luca as known as LucaMCPlayz and Omar as knows as DarkLightBoy. This channel is about learning to code for young people and teenagers. In this channel, we are gonna teach you how to use HTML by many series. We are also gonna learn other programming languages but it will be later after when we finished uploading video tutorial of HTML. Right now we are working on a website where we are gonna put some information about us, for example, our biography and also add coding information. You can contact us if you need help, we can't online full time due to the fact that we are like some of you, we go to school. We will answer and help as soon as possible.Our e-mail will be on the website or in the description box. Feel free to subscribe to our channel if you love our videos and want to stay notified to our series of tutorial, when we will get our bank account, you guys will be able to donate to us. If you do donate, we will really appreciate your donation and you can even have a conversation with us. A lot of people asked us what are we gonna do with the money that we get, it's pretty simple we'll buy a MacBook Air for both of us and save up the rest for college.We have a discord server for our channel community.

About DarkLightBoy/Omar
</div>
  <p> Hi, my name is Omar and I am the best friend of Luca. I was the guy who came up with this idea to make a youtube channel. I started coding earlier than Luca and used c# but quickly quit because I started with a language way to complicated and for beginners. I live pretty close to Luca and we met at a summer camp when we were only 6 years old. I love coding with html, basketball and technologies. I decorated our website since I know some things on CSS. I'm a few months older than Luca and my origin is moroccan and I am born in Canada. I love math same with Luca. As you might see the biography of Luca, he is the dsigner of the website. But I also take decitions too.</p>

  <p>Hi, my name is Luca and I am the best friend of Omar. We created this website and youtube channel for fun and also try to get some cash for college.
        I started coding not long ago, but i learn pretty fast! I'm the designer of our website and Omar is the decorator since he knows the coding language of CSS.
         My hobbies are coding, tennis, video games and math. My dad once told me that coding includes a lot of math and luckly, i'm actually really good at math.
         I'm a young teen, my origin is chinese but i'm born in Canada.
