Hi, my name is Omar and I am the best friend of Luca. I was the guy who came up with this idea to make a youtube channel. I started coding earlier than Luca and used c# but quickly quit because I started with a language way to complicated and for beginners. I live pretty close to Luca and we met at a summer camp when we were only 6 years old. I love coding with html, basketball and technologies. I decorated our website since I know some things on CSS. I'm a few months older than Luca and my origin is moroccan and I am born in Canada. I love math same with Luca. As you might see the biography of Luca, he is the dsigner of the website. But I also take decitions too.

          Hi, my name is Luca and I am the best friend of Omar. We created this website and youtube channel for fun and also try to get some cash for college.
        I started coding not long ago, but i learn pretty fast! I'm the designer of our website and Omar is the decorator since he knows the coding language of CSS.
         My hobbies are coding, tennis, video games and math. My dad once told me that coding includes a lot of math and luckly, i'm actually really good at math.
         I'm a young teen, my origin is chinese but i'm born in Canada.
