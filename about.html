Hi, my name is Omar and I am the best friend of Luca. I am mostly the leader of What Code. I was the guy who came up with this idea to make a youtube channel. I started coding earlier than Luca and used c# but quickly quit because I started with a language way to complicated as a beginner. We met at a summer camp when we were only 6 years old. I love coding on HTML, basketball, math and discovering more about technology. I did the more complicated stuff on the website. My origin is Moroccan and I am born in Canada.

Hi, my name is Luca and I am the best friend of Omar. We created this website and youtube channel for fun and also try to get some cash for college. I started coding not long ago. My hobbies are coding, playing tennis, video games and math. My dad once told me that coding includes a lot of math and luckily, I'm actually really good at math like Omar. My origin is Chinese but I'm born in Canada.
